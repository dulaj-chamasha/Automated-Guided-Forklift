# Automated Guided Forklift 🚜

A smart forklift robot designed for **autonomous cargo handling**.  
It follows a predefined line, detects obstacles, and performs pick-and-place operations using a servo-driven forklift mechanism.  
The system is built on an **Arduino Mega** platform with integrated sensors, motor drivers, and custom 3D-printed hardware.

## ⚙️ Method of Operation
1. **Line Following:** IR sensors track a 3 cm black line on white surface  
2. **Obstacle Handling:** Ultrasonic sensor stops forklift ~2 cm before object  
3. **Cargo Handling:** Servo motor lifts and unloads cargo (5×5×5 cm box, 20–40 g)  
4. **Automation:** Arduino coordinates all sensors and actuators
